# TCP Server 

I want to learn the inner workings of TCP / IP in order to one day build my own protocol or improve existing ones. Since i'm very fluent in python3 and need to catch up on some new changes made to the language. I decided to create this project using existing code I found online so I could break it apart, analyze it , and make my own changes to implement some TCP functionality without using "Quality of Life" tools and libraries. 


First I used ChatGPT to generate a "Homework assignment" for myself ! You can find it in the root directory of the repo ! 


The base code I found from a blog article , the original code is also a gist published by the same person. You can find links to them in the **Sources** section below
